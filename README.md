# sift

**Sift** is a web application that helps home cooks find better recipes. 

## Why? 

The internet is replete with recipes and recipe websites. In fact I think there are actually too many options. A typical search can yield hundreds of results, and it's not immediately clear which recipes are great and which are just ok. In this situation I find myself returning to the same blogs and sites that consistently deliver good recipes. In light of this, I wanted a tool that allows me to search for results across many sites, and then filter to show only the results from the websites I know and can rely on. 

## How it works. 

Users type in a search term and hit search. Upon returning the results, a row of filters shows up below the search bar. Users can select one or more of these filters to adjust the results they see, and if they see a result they like they can click the result to be redirected to the website it came from.

## Technologies involved.

* JavaScript, built using the Vue.js framework
* Bootstrap
* HTML/CSS
* Edamam recipe search API

## Future features

* User profile: Individual user profiles with potential to save your list of favorite recipe sites.
* Recipe collections: Ability to save and organize recipes found from search.
* Share recipes: Ability to send recipes to others, possibly via e-mail/text.
